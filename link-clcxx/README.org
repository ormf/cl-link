* CL-LINK

This is a Lisp Port of the Ableton Link library (including an example
app in examples).

It uses (https://github.com/Islam0mar/cl-cxx and
https://github.com/Islam0mar/CLCXX) to be able to use Ableton's
header-only C++ lib from lisp.

** Prerequisites

   - [[https://github.com/Islam0mar/CLCXX][CLCXX]] has to be installed (follow the instructions on the github page)

   
** Compilation

   cd in the "cl-clcxx" subdir, then:

   - mkdir build

   - cd build

   - cmake ..

   - make

   If this finishes without error, the file =lib/AbletonLink.so=
   should have been generated.
